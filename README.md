# MapsDoupoly
Please create a Homework App
Details: Simple mobile location tracker app
Summary:
- App should show user’s current location on a map and report change of location events
- 3rd party libraries are allowed but ensure that you have your own code to show your coding abilities
- Bonus points if Xamarin.iOS / Xamarin.Android
- Clean and simple is preferred since this is a simple app. Do not over architect it, but clean and testable code is a plus



Features:
- Request location authorization from user
- App detects user’s location
- Show the message “You have moved X meters” when user moves a certain number of meters. Ex: If user moves 20m, show the message “You have moved 20 meters from your position”. If user stays in his current position, or moves less than 20 meters, no message will appear
Bonus Points:
- Unit tests
- Some extra features you can think of



After completing, add a note or README file with
- How to run the app
- Notes on implementations / tradeoffs in building the app
- Architectural considerations
- Parts you put time/focus in implementing
- Code you copied or referenced from Stackoverflow, MSDN, other developer blogs, etc
- Hours spent on app
- Parts of note - something you’re proud to show
